# PyTorch-PyG-implements-the-classical-model-of-graph-neural-network
This column has sorted out "Graph neural network code Practice", which contains related code implementation of different graph neural networks (PyG and self-implementation), combining theory with practice, such as GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE and other classic graph networks, each code instance is attached with complete code.
